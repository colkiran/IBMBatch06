Class Attributes or Class Variables
-----------------------------------
what are class variables?

instance variables vs class variables
-------------------------------------
1. instance variables are accessible by objects
2. its values will vary for different objects


class variables are declared inside the class and outside the methods
class variables are accessed with class name
class variables are static
values of class variable will be same across objects


__init___	= Double Under Score = Dunder_init


Class Method
------------
class methods can create an object of a class
we can also call it as a factory


Static Method
-------------
static method should called using class name

def fun()

self - Object
cls  - class


Operator Overloading
--------------------
+ 	=	__add__	 = magic methods


-----------------------------
we need to overload two comparison operator

1. __eq__ (mandatory)

2. __gt__ (optional, it can be any operator)


write a code to overload all arithmetic operators

1. sum
2. diff
3. product
4. divide
5. floor division

getter, setter and delete methods to properties
